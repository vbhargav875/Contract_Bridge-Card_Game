A Python Application to emulate the Contract-Bridge Card Game using the Minimax Algorithm (popular AI algorithm).
Go through the report to learn the complete implementation.

All About the Game:
1.Rules:
-> Contract Bridge car game is a card game to be played by group of four.

-> The game is always started with the player having the card “Spade-7”.

-> When he first puts the card, the player next can only put the cards closest to “Spade-7”. Here in this case, he would have to choose
from (“Spade-6”,”Spade-8”,”Diamond-7”,”Heart-7”,”Clubs-7”).

-> This means, he could always choose a card which is closer to the card put by previous player so that it could be best for him.

-> Finally, the player who empties all his cards first wins the game.
